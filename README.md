# Odin Project #11: Todo List

The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to create a todo list. The user can create projects and add tasks to them. Each project acts as separate todo list. 

I have recreated this app in React to make code much more readable. I have also added support for routes, improved styling and added Firebase backend for authentication and database features. The new project can be accessed here: https://github.com/brightneon7631/to-do-list-firebase

I started and finished this project in October 2022. Made some changes in June 2023.
